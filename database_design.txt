The entire program makes use of four databases in total, each containing one or more 'bucket' (similar to the idea of a table). All of these buckets use B+ tree internally.

1. URL-ID Mapping database
This database consists of two buckets. 
- URL to ID. The URL string is the key, while the document id is the value.
- ID to URL. The document id is the key, while the URL string is the value.
This database can perform conversion between URL string and URL ID.

2. Word-ID Mapping database
This database consists of two buckets. 
- Word to ID. The keyword is the key, while the word id is the value.
- ID to Word. The word id is the key, while the keyword is the value.
This database can perform conversion between word and word ID.

3. Posting and Forward list database
This database consists of two buckets, each with nested buckets.
- Posting list. The bucket contains multiple buckets, each with word ID as the bucket name. These nested buckets use document ID as the key, and a struct which contains term frequency and the position of the word as the value.
- Forward list. The bucket contains multiple buckets, each with document ID as the bucket name. These nested buckets use word ID as the key, and a dummy value. This is to represent which terms are in the the document.

This database is used to perform searching on the terms. It can also be used to look for all the terms in a document.

4. Document information database
This database consist of one bucket only.
It uses document ID as the key, and it has a struct which contains relevant information about the document, like size, last modification date, etc.
